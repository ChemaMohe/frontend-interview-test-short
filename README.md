ONTRAPORT Front-End Evaluation, Short Test
=============================

Howdy! Welcome to the ONTRAPORT front-end short test. Thank you for your interest in working with us.
Before we can continue with your application we would like you to complete a short test.  


###Test description:
The objective of this test is to have you complete a short front-end task. This will let 
us gauge your understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Please use any industry standards, best practices, performance tips and 
code style that you support. We are looking for engineers with varying skill levels so do your best.
Thank you for taking the time to take our test.

###Requirements:
0. All computation must take place on the client. Sorry no posting to the server, we want to see your
   front end skills.
1. To get started fork this repo into your own GitHub account. 
2. Using the existing form markup in `index.html`, create a script that on form submit 
   prepends the contents of the from `<input type="text" name="post" placeholder="thoughts?"/>` 
   to `<div id="page">`. 
3. For each input value prepended, concatenate the second of the current browser date to 
   the input value.
4. Commit your code to your public git repo or zip it up. Then send us an email with the subject 
   "Front-end short test" that contains a link to your repo or has your test zip attached.
   
There is a time and place for javascript frameworks. This might not be it. We want to see your javascript skills so we 
would like to see your solution be done in vanilla javascript, jQuery or a similar javascript library. That being said 
if you feel strongly that this problem needs a framework by all means use one and tell us why.

###Example:
Check out the GIF below to see a working example of what a finished test might act like.
